# SSH Keychain Command Palette Extension

A Windows Command Palette extension that allows you to quickly access your SSH connections directly from the Command Palette.  
As an alternative to my GUI-based App: [VerySSH](https://github.com/m-a-x-s-e-e-l-i-g/very-ssh)

## Features

- Automatically discovers SSH hosts from your SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`)
- Displays all your SSH connections in the Windows Command Palette
- One-click connection to any SSH host

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 with Windows Command Palette support. [Install PowerToys](https://aka.ms/installpowertoys)
- SSH client configured with a valid `~/.ssh/config` file

## Usage

1. Open Windows Command Palette (Win+Alt+Space)
2. Type "SSH" to filter for SSH connections
3. Select the host you want to connect to
4. Terminal will automatically open with an SSH session to the selected host

## Configuration

The extension automatically reads your SSH configuration from `~/.ssh/config`. Make sure this file exists and is properly formatted. Example:

```
Host github
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_github

Host myserver
    HostName example.com
    User admin
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## Building from Source

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022 or later
3. Build the solution
4. Deploy the package to your local machine for testing
